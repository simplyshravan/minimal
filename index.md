### Lending Club Case Study

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

*  If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

*  If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

### Housing Prices

Business Goal

We are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

The company wants to know:

 1) Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
 2) How well those variables describe the price of a house.
